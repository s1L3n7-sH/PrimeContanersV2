# Video Implementation Instructions

To properly implement the video background for the header:

1. Download the video file from: https://www.conexwest.com/sites/default/files/0806%282%29-1.mp4

2. Save it as `header-video.mp4` in this directory (public/videos/)

3. The component will first try to load the local video file, and if that fails, it will fall back to the external URL.

4. Once you have the video file in place, restart your development server to ensure the video loads properly.
